# PyMood
An experimental prototype for the "Safe Zone" game jam, aimed at testing the capabilities of vibe coding in a game setting. Instead of starting from scratch, this project explores how Pygame and ChatGPT can be used to rapidly prototype a mini-demo of the final project—without manually altering the code itself.

The following sections will explore the iterations in this process, with prompts followed by links to the associated commits in the code.


# Iteration No. 1
```
I want to participate in a game jam and I only have 4 hours.
Give me a game idea and a suggestion for how I can build it.

JamMamad is a game jam — a marathon of game creation where participants build a game around a common theme.
This time, the theme is already known:
Safe Zone
What is your safe zone? A place? An idea? A feeling? And how can it become a game?
```
```
Can u make a simple demo in Pygame?
```
